# CRUD Application Portfolio

## Overview

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that demonstrates my full-stack development skills using **Next.js** for the front-end and **Spring Boot** for the back-end. This project serves as a portfolio piece to showcase my ability to build a functional web application with a clean and responsive user interface, as well as a robust and efficient back-end.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A welcoming home page that explains the functionality of the CRUD system, providing users with a clear understanding of how the application works.
- **Person Registration**: A user-friendly form to register new people with fields for first name, last name, email, and address.
- **View Registered People**: A dedicated page that displays the total number of registered people along with a list of all entries, showcasing my ability to retrieve and present data effectively.

## Technology Stack

### Front-End:
- **Next.js**: Used for building the user interface, providing a fast and interactive experience.
- **React**: To manage the component-based architecture of the application.
- **Tailwind**: To make this application beaty.

### Back-End:
- **Spring Boot**: Used to develop the back-end services, handling the business logic and database interactions.
- **Spring Security**: Integrated to secure the application, providing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Hibernate/JPA**: For managing the database operations and mapping Java objects to database entities.
- **REST API**: To allow the front-end to communicate seamlessly with the back-end services.

### Database:
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database used for demonstration purposes. It can be easily replaced with other relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
